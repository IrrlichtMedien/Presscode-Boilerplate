# About Presscode Boilerplate (PCBP)

Presscode Boilerplate is a HTML5/CSS3/LessCSS made
'not-that-blank-Theme' based on the famous 'HTML5BP' by Paul Irish and Divya Manian. The idea was to take all the best out of this rock-solid Boilerplate, mix it up with some other first-class components and sum everything up with a lot of different fixed and new ideas.

## *So what can PCBP offer you?*
It offers you all you need for rapid development of any kind of website. Starting with a very solid browser-reset PCBP offers you a best-practice file-structure, high-quality typography based on the 'Baseline Typography CSS' and Adobe's new free font SourceSans Pro in three weights. Looking at the designer part of PCBP you will find two ways to go: the first one is classic CSS, the second and way more comfortable way is using LessCSS for all the design you need. The basic structure of a blank theme is stored in the layout.less and you can add nearly everything you can imagine in the empty custom.less. If you don't like what's already there: no problem! 
Just remove it and start coding whatever you want and PCBP will help you out with a lot of different options you can use - if you'd like to.
The base-design is mobile first, responsive and very comfortable for designers, because it fits perfect to the whole structure, offers solid media-queries and a rock solid, flexible structure. Did I already mention it's less than 1MB?! I don't want to write that much: just have a look at it, it's fun Nerds!


## *Why?*
After all I'm webdesigner by myself and wanted to create a solid platform for my own work. In my opinion I developed a pretty cool framework you can use direct for your production. On one hand it offers everything you need while developing the frontend of a design, on the other hand it's minimalistic enough you don't need hours to clean it up to start working. 
Everyone should be able to bring the web to the next level of highly flexible and dynamic solutions and that's why I decided to license it under Creative Commons license - more information about it is in the license.txt


Have fun with it and please, if you used it for a project: drop me a line, I'd like to know more about it.
